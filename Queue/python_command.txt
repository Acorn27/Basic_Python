See all Python versions available on the system and their path: 
    py -0p
Create virtual environment:
    1. Add python version of choice to venv, venvName can be any name you prefer
        + path\path\path\python.exe -m venv venvName (a copy of current python to a new venvName)
    2. activate environment: 
        + source venvName/bin/activate: mac/unix
        + venvName/Script/activate.bat: window (add python path to the beginning of %PATH%: echo %PATH% to see the difference)
    3. pip install everything(included pip install -r requirements): newly installed package will go only into your vritual environment sub-folder
    4. run deactivate.bat to exit virtual environment
Note: There might be multiple python versions install in your machine. Installation folder or path depend on how you installed your python at the first place
(window appstore, microsoft visual studio, python.org...). The first two installation method won't be update very oftenly and usually out of date. I would recommended install python through
py.org, then set it path to python.exe and pip.exe to the top priority. Never install any package directly to you system py, alternatively create a virtual enviroment and put everything in it
Keep your system nice and clean.
