Create virtual environment:
    1. Add python version to venv, venvName can be any name you want
        + path\path\path\python.exe -m venv venvName (a copy of current python to a new venvName)
    2. activate environment: 
        + source venvName/bin/activate: mac/unix
        + source venvName/Script/activate.bat: window (add python path to the beginning of %PATH%: echo %PATH% to see the difference)
